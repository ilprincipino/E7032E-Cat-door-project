    Started with PCB design with Jakob.
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Worked with Jakob with pcb design.
    Meeting with the best people. :)
    Kept working with pcb design schematics
    Worked with choosing what components we need to order. 
  Wednesday:
    Worked with Jakob with pcb design.
    Solder wires to the catflap with Matilda.
    Kept working with the PCB and kept working on ordering components.
    
  Thursday:
    Added correct footprint and searched for parts.
    Kept working on the PCB and its finish. :)
        
  Friday:
    Worked with Agnes to get a circuit for the IR-sensor.
    Finish the PCB and order components.    

    

WEEK 39:
  Monday:
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Meeting with the group.
    Worked with Matilda on getting the LEDS to work with button and also manage to control the motor with some buttons.
    
  Wednesday:
    Moral support for Matilda when she fixed the two buttons to work for the LED.
    Tested to assembly the catflap and see if the catflap responded to a tag, but no sucess.
    
  Thursday:
    Nothing.
  Friday:
    Nothing.

  Sunday:
    Found some IC for the PCB and looked more into powermanagement.


WEEK 38:
  Monday:
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Meeting with the peebs.
    Starting to work with powermanagement of the project.
    Looked in to Raspberry pi pico and RP2040.

  Wednesday:
    Worked with Matilda to control some led's and also measure the voltage of the Motor with a oscilloscope.
    Planned with Matilda and Nabaz on how the buttons are gonna operate on the PCB, what button do what.

  Thursday:
    Tested in practice some circuits for MOSFET application in order to learn and use it in some parts of the project.

  Friday:
    Worked with Matilda as we manage to get the raspberry pi pico to work with python code.
    Played around with some LEDs and Button in order to learn and implement them in the project.
    Planned work for next week.
    Helped Matilda fixed powerpoint for next week.
    Did some planning for the future of the project.


WEEK 37:
  Monday:
    Had a meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Worked on controlling a DC-motor and be able to drive it in different directions with the help of and H-Bro.
  
  Wednesday:
    Made the H-Bridge better with MOSFET in order to draw more current compare to the BJT (200mA).
  
  Thursday:
    And measure the motor and determine that we are done with that part of the whole project.
    Find a H-brdige IC that are able to handle our motor and be able to controll it with a microcontroller. 
    Manage to get more lab equipment in order to do basic measurements in the project room.
    Helped Nabaz with IR-sensor.
  
  Friday:
    Talked to Joakim to find where our order stuff are.
    Email Jan in order to see where the components are.
    Did more planning for the entire project and see how its going.
    Help with flowchart of what happens when the cat goes in the cat flap.
